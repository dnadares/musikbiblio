Introduction
============
  musikbiblio pretends to fill the apparent gap that there is with music organizers. After trying several, none of them
  met all the requirements we wanted on a single program... Using several just didn't sound right.

  musikbiblio is divided into two different parts. A web frontend which let users see what we have in our database and
  contribute to it. And a desktop frontend which lets the users tag and organize their music libraries.
